<p>Welcome to <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/book" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Web Development with Rails</em></a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The purpose of this book is to teach you how to develop custom web applications, and our tool of choice is the popular <a href="http://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby on Rails</a> web framework.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In addition to focusing on general principles of web development (rather than on Rails specifically), the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> teaches the broader skill of <em>technical sophistication</em> (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#aside-technical_sophistication" class="hyperref">Box <span class="ref">1.1</span></a>),<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-1" class="footnote"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-1">1</a></sup> which is a principal theme developed by the <a href="http://learnenough.com/story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> tutorials.<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-2" class="footnote intersentence"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-2">2</a></sup><span class="intersentencespace"></span> In particular, the Learn Enough introductory sequence consists of a series of tutorials that are suitable as prerequisites to the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>, starting with <a href="http://learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous</em></a>,<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-3" class="footnote"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-3">3</a></sup> which (unlike the present tutorial) is aimed at complete beginners.</p>

<span class="description">Technical sophistication</span></div>
<p>The <a href="http://railstutorial.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> is part of the <a href="http://learnenough.com/story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> family of tutorials, which develop the theme of <em>technical sophistication</em>: the combination of hard and soft skills that make it seem like you can magically solve any technical problem (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#fig-tech_support_cheat_sheet" class="hyperref">Figure <span class="ref">1.1</span></a>).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Web development, and computer programming in general, are essential components of technical sophistication, but there’s more to it than that—you also have to know how to click around menu items to learn the capabilities of a particular application, how to clarify a confusing error message by <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Googling it</a>, or when to give up and just reboot the darn thing.</p>
<p>Because web applications have so many moving parts, they offer ample opportunities to develop your technical sophistication.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In the context of Rails web development, some specific examples of technical sophistication include making sure you’re using the right Ruby gem versions, running <code class="tt">bundle install</code> or <code class="tt">bundle update</code>, and restarting the local webserver if something doesn’t work.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> (Don’t worry if all this sounds like gibberish; we’ll cover everything mentioned here in the course of completing this tutorial.)</p>
<p>As you proceed through this tutorial, in all likelihood you will occasionally be tripped up by things not immediately working as expected.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Although some particularly tricky steps are explicitly highlighted in the text, it is impossible to anticipate all the things that can go wrong.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I recommend you embrace these inevitable stumbling blocks as opportunities to work on improving your technical sophistication.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Or, as we say in <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial#aside-speak_geek" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geek speak</a>: <em>It’s not a bug, it’s a feature!</em></p>

<p>The <em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> is designed to give you a thorough introduction to web application development, including a basic grounding in Ruby, Rails, HTML &amp; CSS, databases, version control, testing, and deployment—sufficient to launch you on a career as a web developer or technology entrepreneur.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you already know web development, this book will quickly teach you the essentials of the Rails framework, including MVC and REST, generators, migrations, routing, and embedded Ruby.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In any case, when you finish the <em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> you will be in a position to benefit from the many more advanced books, blogs, and screencasts that are part of the thriving programming educational ecosystem.<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-4" class="footnote"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The <em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> takes an integrated approach to web development by building three example applications of increasing sophistication, starting with a minimal <em>hello</em> app (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-the_hello_application" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.3</span></a>), a slightly more capable <em>toy</em> app (<a href="toy_app_fragment.html#cha-a_toy_app" class="hyperref">Chapter <span class="ref">2</span></a>), and a real <em>sample</em> app (<a href="static_pages_fragment.html#cha-static_pages" class="hyperref">Chapter <span class="ref">3</span></a> through <a href="following_users_fragment.html#cha-following_users" class="hyperref">Chapter <span class="ref">14</span></a>).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As implied by their generic names, the applications developed in the <em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> are not specific to any particular kind of website.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The final sample application bears more than a passing resemblance to <a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> (which, coincidentally, was also originally written in Rails), but the emphasis throughout the tutorial is on general principles, so you will have a solid foundation no matter what kinds of web applications you want to build.</p>
<p>In this first chapter, we’ll get started with Ruby on Rails by installing all the necessary software and by setting up our development environment (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-up_and_running" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.2</span></a>).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We’ll then create our first Rails application, called <code>hello_app</code>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The <em>Rails Tutorial</em> emphasizes good software development practices, so immediately after creating our fresh new Rails project we’ll put it under version control with Git (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-version_control" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.4</span></a>).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And, believe it or not, in this chapter we’ll even put our first app on the wider web by <em>deploying</em> it to production (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-deploying" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.5</span></a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="toy_app_fragment.html#cha-a_toy_app" class="hyperref">Chapter <span class="ref">2</span></a>, we’ll make a second project, whose purpose is to demonstrate the basic workings of a Rails application.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To get up and running quickly, we’ll build this <em>toy app</em> (called <code>toy_app</code>) using scaffolding (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#aside-scaffolding" class="hyperref">Box <span class="ref">1.2</span></a>) to generate code; because this code is both ugly and complex, <a href="toy_app_fragment.html#cha-a_toy_app" class="hyperref">Chapter <span class="ref">2</span></a> will focus on interacting with the toy app through its <em>URIs</em> (often called <em>URLs</em>)<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-5" class="footnote"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-5">5</a></sup> using a web browser.</p>
<p>The rest of the tutorial focuses on developing a single large <em>real sample application</em> (called <code>sample_app</code>), writing all the code from scratch.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We’ll develop the sample app using a combination of <em>mockups</em>, <em>test-driven development</em> (TDD), and <em>integration tests</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We’ll get started in <a href="static_pages_fragment.html#cha-static_pages" class="hyperref">Chapter <span class="ref">3</span></a> by creating static pages and then add a little dynamic content.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We’ll take a quick detour in <a href="rails_flavored_ruby_fragment.html#cha-rails_flavored_ruby" class="hyperref">Chapter <span class="ref">4</span></a> to learn a little about the Ruby language underlying Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Then, in <a href="filling_in_the_layout_fragment.html#cha-filling_in_the_layout" class="hyperref">Chapter <span class="ref">5</span></a> through <a href="password_reset_fragment.html#cha-password_reset" class="hyperref">Chapter <span class="ref">12</span></a>, we’ll complete the foundation for the sample application by making a site layout, a user data model, and a full registration and authentication system (including account activation and password resets).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Finally, in <a href="user_microposts_fragment.html#cha-user_microposts" class="hyperref">Chapter <span class="ref">13</span></a> and <a href="following_users_fragment.html#cha-following_users" class="hyperref">Chapter <span class="ref">14</span></a> we’ll add microblogging and social features to make a working example site.</p>
<div class="aside" id="aside-scaffolding" data-tralics-id="uid9" data-number="1.2"><div class="heading"><span class="number">Box 1.2.</span> 

<span class="description">Scaffolding: Quicker, easier, more seductive</span></div>
<p>From the beginning, Rails has benefited from a palpable sense of excitement, starting with the famous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzj723LkRJY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15-minute weblog video</a> by Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That video and its successors are a great way to get a taste of Rails’ power, and I recommend watching them.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But be warned: they accomplish their amazing fifteen-minute feat using a feature called <em>scaffolding</em>, which relies heavily on <em>generated code</em>, magically created by the Rails <code>generate scaffold</code> command.</p>
<p>When writing a Ruby on Rails tutorial, it is tempting to rely on the scaffolding approach—it’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_side_(Star_Wars)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quicker, easier, more seductive</a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But the complexity and sheer amount of code in the scaffolding can be utterly overwhelming to a beginning Rails developer; you may be able to use it, but you probably won’t understand it.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Following the scaffolding approach risks turning you into a virtuoso script generator with little (and brittle) actual knowledge of Rails.</p>
<p>In the <em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em>, we’ll take the (nearly) polar opposite approach: although <a href="toy_app_fragment.html#cha-a_toy_app" class="hyperref">Chapter <span class="ref">2</span></a> will develop a small toy app using scaffolding, the core of the <em>Rails Tutorial</em> is the sample app, which we’ll start writing in <a href="static_pages_fragment.html#cha-static_pages" class="hyperref">Chapter <span class="ref">3</span></a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> At each stage of developing the sample application, we will write <em>small, bite-sized</em> pieces of code—simple enough to understand, yet novel enough to be challenging.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The cumulative effect will be a deeper, more flexible knowledge of Rails, giving you a good background for writing nearly any type of web application.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails (or just “Rails” for short) is a web development framework written in the Ruby programming language.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Since its debut in 2004, Ruby on Rails has rapidly become one of the most powerful and popular tools for building dynamic web applications.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rails is used by companies as varied as <a href="http://airbnb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airbnb</a>, <a href="http://basecamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Basecamp</a>, <a href="http://disney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disney</a>, <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, <a href="http://hulu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hulu</a>, <a href="http://kickstarter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kickstarter</a>, <a href="http://shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>, and the <a href="http://yellowpages.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yellow Pages</a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There are also many web development shops that specialize in Rails, such as <a href="http://entp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ENTP</a>, <a href="http://thoughtbot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thoughtbot</a>, <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pivotal Labs</a>, <a href="http://hashrocket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hashrocket</a>, and <a href="http://www.happyfuncorp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HappyFunCorp</a>, plus innumerable independent consultants, trainers, and contractors.</p>
<p>What makes Rails so great?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> First of all, Ruby on Rails is 100% open-source, available under the generous <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT License</a>, and as a result it also costs nothing to download or use.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rails also owes much of its success to its elegant and compact design; by exploiting the malleability of the underlying <a href="http://ruby-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby</a> language, Rails effectively creates a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Specific_Language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">domain-specific language</a> for writing web applications.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As a result, many common web programming tasks—such as generating HTML, making data models, and routing URLs—are easy with Rails, and the resulting application code is concise and readable.</p>
<p>Rails also adapts rapidly to new developments in web technology and framework design.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For example, Rails was one of the first frameworks to fully digest and implement the REST architectural style for structuring web applications (which we’ll be learning about throughout this tutorial).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And when other frameworks develop successful new techniques, Rails creator <a href="http://loudthinking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> and the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/core" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rails core team</a> don’t hesitate to incorporate their ideas.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Perhaps the most dramatic example is the merger of Rails and Merb, a rival Ruby web framework, so that Rails now benefits from Merb’s modular design, stable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">API</a>, and improved performance.</p>
<p>Finally, Rails benefits from an unusually enthusiastic and supportive community.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The results include thousands of open-source <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributors</a>, fun and informative <a href="http://railsconf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conferences</a>, a huge number of <a href="https://rubygems.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gems</a> (self-contained solutions to specific problems such as pagination and image upload), a rich variety of informative blogs, and a cornucopia of discussion forums and IRC channels.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The large number of Rails programmers also makes it easier to handle the inevitable application errors: the “Google the error message” algorithm nearly always produces a relevant blog post or discussion-forum thread.</p>

<p>There are no formal prerequisites to this book, and the <em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> contains integrated tutorials not only for Rails, but also for the underlying Ruby language, the default Rails testing framework (minitest), the Unix command line, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSS</a>, a small amount of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JavaScript</a>, and even a little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SQL</a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s a lot of material to absorb, though, and I generally recommend having some HTML and programming background before starting this tutorial.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you’re new to software development, I recommend starting with the tutorials at <a href="http://learnenough.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> instead:<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-6" class="footnote"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-6">6</a></sup></p>

<p>One common question when learning Rails is whether to learn Ruby first.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The answer depends on your personal learning style and how much programming experience you already have.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you prefer to learn everything systematically from the ground up, or if you have never programmed before, then learning Ruby first might work well for you, and in this case I recommend following the full Learn Enough sequence listed above.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> On the other hand, many beginning Rails developers are excited about making <em>web</em> applications, and would rather not wait to finish a whole book on Ruby before ever writing a single web page.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In this case, I recommend giving this tutorial a go and switching to the Learn Enough sequence if it proves too challenging.</p>
<p>At the end of this tutorial, no matter where you started, you should be ready for the many more intermediate-to-advanced Rails resources out there.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Here are some I particularly recommend:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://railstutorial.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> contains a large number of exercises.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Solving them as you proceed through the tutorial is strongly recommended.</p>
<p>In order to keep the main discussion independent of the exercises, the solutions are not generally incorporated into subsequent code listings.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> (In the rare circumstance that an exercise solution is used subsequently, it is explicitly solved in the main text.)<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This means that over time your code may diverge from the code shown in the tutorial due to differences introduced in the exercises.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Learning how to resolve such discrepancies is a valuable exercise in technical sophistication (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#aside-technical_sophistication" class="hyperref">Box <span class="ref">1.1</span></a>).</p>
<p>To record your answers and see solutions, you can join the <a href="http://learnenough.com/story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn Enough Society</a>, a subscription service from <a href="http://learnenough.com/story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> that includes a special enhanced version of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the exercises are challenging, but we’ll start out with some easy ones just to get warmed up:</p>

<div id="sec-conventions" data-tralics-id="uid40" class="subsection" data-number="1.1.2"><h3><a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-conventions" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">1.1.2 </span>Conventions used in this book</a></h3>
<p>The conventions used in this book are mostly self-explanatory.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In this section, we’ll go over some that may not be.</p>
<p>Many examples in this book use command-line commands.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For simplicity, all command line examples use a Unix-style command line prompt (a dollar sign), as follows:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"hello, world"</span>
<span class="go">hello, world</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>Rails comes with many commands that can be run at the command line.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For example, in <a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-rails_server" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.3.2</span></a> we’ll run a local development webserver with the <code>rails server</code> command:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>rails server
</pre></div></div>
<p>As with the command-line prompt, the <em>Rails Tutorial</em> uses the Unix convention for directory separators (i.e., a forward slash <code>/</code>).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For example, the sample application <code>production.rb</code> configuration file appears as follows:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre>config/environments/production.rb
</pre></div></div>
<p>This file path should be understood as being relative to the application’s root directory, which will vary by system; on the cloud IDE (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-development_environment" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.2.1</span></a>), it looks like this:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre>/home/ubuntu/workspace/sample_app/
</pre></div></div>
<p>Thus, the full path to <code>production.rb</code> is</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre>/home/ubuntu/workspace/sample_app/config/environments/production.rb
</pre></div></div>
<p>I will typically omit the application path and write just <code>config/environments/production.rb</code> for short.</p>
<p>The <em>Rails Tutorial</em> often shows output from various programs.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Because of the innumerable small differences between different computer systems, the output you see may not always agree exactly with what is shown in the text,
but this is not cause for concern.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In addition, some commands may produce errors depending on your system; rather than attempt the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sisyphean</a> task of documenting all such errors in this tutorial, I will delegate to the “Google the error message” algorithm, which among other things is good practice for real-life software development (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#aside-technical_sophistication" class="hyperref">Box <span class="ref">1.1</span></a>).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you run into any problems while following the tutorial, I suggest consulting the resources listed in the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/help" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rails Tutorial help page</a>.<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-7" class="footnote"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Because the <em>Rails Tutorial</em> covers testing of Rails applications, it is often helpful to know if a particular piece of code causes the test suite to fail (indicated by the color red) or pass (indicated by the color green).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For convenience, code resulting in a failing test is thus indicated with <span style="color: red"><span class="sc"></span><span class="sc"><strong>red</strong></span><span class="sc"></span></span>, while code resulting in a passing test is indicated with <span style="color: ForestGreen"><span class="sc"></span><span class="sc"><strong>green</strong></span><span class="sc"></span></span>.</p>
<p>Finally, for convenience the <em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> adopts two conventions designed to make the many code samples easier to understand.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> First, some code listings include one or more highlighted lines, as seen below:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationRecord</span>
  <span class="n">validates</span> <span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="ss">presence</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
<span class="hll">  <span class="n">validates</span> <span class="ss">:email</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">presence</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
</span><span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>Such highlighted lines typically indicate the most important new code in the given sample, and often (though not always) represent the difference between the present code listing and previous listings.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Second, for brevity and simplicity many of the book’s code listings include vertical dots, as follows:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationRecord</span>
  <span class="o">.</span>
  <span class="o">.</span>
  <span class="o">.</span>
  <span class="n">has_secure_password</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>These dots represent omitted code and should not be copied literally.</p>
</div></div><div id="sec-up_and_running" data-tralics-id="cid3" class="section" data-number="1.2"><h2><a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-up_and_running" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">1.2 </span>Up and running</a></h2>
<p>Even for experienced Rails developers, installing Ruby, Rails, and all the associated supporting software can be an exercise in frustration.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Compounding the problem is the multiplicity of environments: different operating systems, version numbers, preferences in text editor and integrated development environment (IDE), etc.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The <a href="http://railstutorial.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> offers two recommended solutions to this problem.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> One possibility is to follow the full <a href="http://learnenough.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn Enough</a> intro sequence mentioned in <a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-prerequisites" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.1.1</span></a>, which will automatically lead to a system configured for this tutorial.</p>
<p>The other possibility, recommended for newer users, is to sidestep such installation and configuration issues by using a <em>cloud integrated development environment</em>, or cloud IDE.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The cloud IDE used in this tutorial runs inside an ordinary web browser, and hence works the same across different platforms, which is especially useful for operating systems (such as Windows) on which Rails development has historically been difficult.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It also maintains the current state of your work, so you can take a break from the tutorial and come back to the system just as you left it.</p>
<div id="sec-development_environment" data-tralics-id="uid42" class="subsection" data-number="1.2.1"><h3><a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-development_environment" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">1.2.1 </span>Development environment</a></h3>
<p>Considering various idiosyncratic customizations, there are probably as many development environments as there are Rails programmers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To avoid this complexity, the <em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> standardizes on the excellent cloud development environment <a href="http://c9.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloud9</a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In particular, I am pleased to be partnering with Cloud9 to offer a free development environment specifically tailored to the needs of this tutorial.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The resulting Rails Tutorial Cloud9 workspace comes pre-configured with most of the software needed for professional-grade Rails development, including Ruby, RubyGems, Git.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> (Indeed, the only big piece of software we’ll install separately is Rails itself, and this is intentional (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-installing_rails" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.2.2</span></a>).)</p>
<p>Although you are welcome to develop your application locally, setting up a Rails development environment can be challenging, so I recommend the cloud IDE for most readers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For those who want to go the local route, try the steps at <a href="http://installrails.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">InstallRails.com</a>, and be prepared for a challenging exercise in technical sophistication (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#aside-technical_sophistication" class="hyperref">Box <span class="ref">1.1</span></a>).</p>
<p>The cloud IDE includes the three essential components needed to develop web applications: a text editor, a filesystem navigator, and a command-line terminal (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#fig-ide_anatomy" class="hyperref">Figure <span class="ref">1.2</span></a>).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Among other features, the cloud IDE text editor supports the “Find in Files” global search that I consider essential to navigating any large Ruby or Rails project.<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-8" class="footnote"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-8">8</a></sup><span class="intersentencespace"></span> Finally, even if you decide not to use the cloud IDE exclusively in real life (and I certainly recommend learning other tools as well), it provides an excellent introduction to the general capabilities of text editors and other development tools.</p>

</span></div></div>
<p>Here are the steps for getting started with the cloud development environment:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://c9.io/web/sign-up/free" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sign up for a free account at Cloud9</a>.<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-9" class="footnote intersentence"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-9">9</a></sup><span class="intersentencespace"></span> In order to prevent abuse, Cloud9 requires a valid credit card for signup, but the Rails Tutorial workspace is 100% free, and your card will not be charged.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Click on “Go to your Dashboard”.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Select “Create New Workspace”.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>As shown in <a href="beginning_fragment.html#fig-cloud9_new_workspace" class="hyperref">Figure <span class="ref">1.3</span></a>, create a workspace called “rails-tutorial” (<em>not</em> “rails_tutorial”), set it to “Private to the people I invite”, and select the icon for the Rails Tutorial (<em>not</em> the icon for Ruby on Rails).<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Click “Create workspace”.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>After Cloud9 has finished provisioning the workspace, it should start automatically.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ol>
<p>Because using two spaces for indentation is a near-universal convention in Ruby, I also recommend changing the editor to use two spaces instead of the default four.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As shown in <a href="beginning_fragment.html#fig-cloud9_two_spaces" class="hyperref">Figure <span class="ref">1.4</span></a>, you can do this by clicking the gear icon in the upper right and then selecting “Code Editor (Ace)” to edit the “Soft Tabs” setting.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> (Note that this takes effect immediately; you don’t need to click a “Save” button.)</p>

<p>Following a <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hello-world.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long tradition</a> in computer programming, our goal for the first application is to write a “hello, world” program.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In particular, we will create a simple application that displays the string “hello, world!” on a web page, both on our development environment (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-hello_world" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.3.4</span></a>) and on the live web (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-deploying" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.5</span></a>).</p>
<p>Virtually all Rails applications start the same way, by running the <code>rails new</code> command.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This handy command creates a skeleton Rails application in a directory of your choice.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To get started, users <em>not</em> using the Cloud9 IDE recommended in <a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-development_environment" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.2.1</span></a> should make a <code>workspace</code> directory for your Rails projects if it doesn’t already exist (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#code-mkdir_rails_projects" class="hyperref">Listing <span class="ref">1.2</span></a>) and then change into the directory.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#code-mkdir_rails_projects" class="hyperref">Listing <span class="ref">1.2</span></a> uses the Unix commands <code>cd</code> and <code>mkdir</code>; see <a href="beginning_fragment.html#aside-unix_commands" class="hyperref">Box <span class="ref">1.3</span></a> if you are not already familiar with these commands.)</p>

<span class="description">A crash course on the Unix command line</span></div>
<p>For readers coming from Windows or (to a lesser but still significant extent) macOS, the Unix command line may be unfamiliar.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Luckily, if you are using the recommended cloud environment, you automatically have access to a Unix (Linux) command line running a standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shell command-line interface</a> known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bash</a>.</p>
<p>The basic idea of the command line is simple: by issuing short commands, users can perform a large number of operations, such as creating directories (<code class="tt">mkdir</code>), moving and copying files (<code class="tt">mv</code> and <code class="tt">cp</code>), and navigating the filesystem by changing directories (<code class="tt">cd</code>).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Although the command line may seem primitive to users mainly familiar with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), appearances are deceiving: the command line is one of the most powerful tools in the developer’s toolbox.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Indeed, you will rarely see the desktop of an experienced developer without several open terminal windows running command-line shells.</p>
<p>The general subject is deep, but for the purposes of this tutorial we will need only a few of the most common Unix command-line commands, as summarized in <a href="beginning_fragment.html#table-unix_commands" class="hyperref">Table <span class="ref">1.1</span></a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For a more thorough introduction to the Unix command line, see the first of the <a href="http://learnenough.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn Enough</a> tutorials, <a href="http://learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous</em></a>.<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-10" class="footnote"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-10">10</a></sup></p>

</pre></div></div></div><p>Many of these lines are commented out with the hash symbol <code>#</code> (<a href="rails_flavored_ruby_fragment.html#sec-comments" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">4.2.1</span></a>); they are there to show you some commonly needed gems and to give examples of the Bundler syntax.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For now, we won’t need any gems other than the defaults.</p>
<p>Unless you specify a version number to the <code>gem</code> command, Bundler will automatically install the latest requested version of the gem.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This is the case, for example, in the code</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'sqlite3'</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>There are also two common ways to specify a gem version range, which allows us to exert some control over the version used by Rails.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The first looks like this:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'uglifier'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'&gt;= 1.3.0'</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>This installs the latest version of the <code>uglifier</code> gem (which handles file compression for the asset pipeline) as long as it’s greater than or equal to version <code>1.3.0</code>—even if it’s, say, version <code>7.2</code>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The second method looks like this:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'coffee-rails'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'~&gt; 4.0.0'</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>This installs the gem <code>coffee-rails</code> as long as it’s newer than version <code>4.0.0</code> and <em>not</em> newer than <code>4.1</code>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In other words, the <code>&gt;=</code> notation always installs the latest gem, whereas the <code>~&gt; 4.0.0</code> notation only installs updated gems where the last digit differs (e.g., from <code>4.0.0</code> to <code>4.0.1</code>), but the digits before that releases (e.g., from <code>4.0</code> to <code>4.1</code>).<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-12" class="footnote"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-12">12</a></sup><span class="intersentencespace"></span> Unfortunately, experience shows that even minor point releases can break the application, so for the <em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> we’ll err on the side of caution by including exact version numbers for all gems.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You are welcome to use the most up-to-date version of any gem, including using the <span class="inline_verbatim">~&gt;</span> construction in the <code>Gemfile</code> (which I generally recommend for more advanced users), but be warned that this may cause the tutorial to act unpredictably.</p>
<p>Converting the <code>Gemfile</code> in <a href="beginning_fragment.html#code-default_gemfile" class="hyperref">Listing <span class="ref">1.4</span></a> to use exact gem versions results in the code shown in <a href="beginning_fragment.html#code-gemfile_sqlite_version" class="hyperref">Listing <span class="ref">1.5</span></a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> (You can determine the exact version number for each gem by running <code>gem list &lt;gem name&gt;</code> at the command line, but <a href="beginning_fragment.html#code-gemfile_sqlite_version" class="hyperref">Listing <span class="ref">1.5</span></a> saves you the trouble.)<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Note that we’ve also taken this opportunity to arrange for the <code class="tt">sqlite3</code> gem to be included only in a development or test environment (<a href="sign_up_fragment.html#sec-rails_environments" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">7.1.1</span></a>), which prevents potential conflicts with the database used by Heroku (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-deploying" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.5</span></a>).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> <strong>Important note: For all the Gemfiles in this book, you should use the version numbers listed at <a href="http://gemfiles-4th-ed.railstutorial.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gemfiles-4th-ed.railstutorial.org</a> instead of the ones listed below (although they should be identical if you are reading this online).</strong></p>

<p>When interacting with a Rails application, a browser sends a <em>request</em>, which is received by a webserver and passed on to a Rails <em>controller</em>, which is in charge of what to do next.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In some cases, the controller will immediately render a <em>view</em>, which is a template that gets converted to HTML and sent back to the browser.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> More commonly for dynamic sites, the controller interacts with a <em>model</em>, which is a Ruby object that represents an element of the site (such as a user) and is in charge of communicating with the database.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> After invoking the model, the controller then renders the view and returns the complete web page to the browser as HTML.</p>

<p>As a first application of the MVC framework, we’ll make a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Creosote" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wafer-thin</a> change to the first app by adding a <em>controller action</em> to render the string “hello, world!” to replace the default Rails page from <a href="beginning_fragment.html#fig-riding_rails" class="hyperref">Figure <span class="ref">1.10</span></a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> (We’ll learn more about controller actions starting in <a href="toy_app_fragment.html#sec-mvc_in_action" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">2.2.2</span></a>.)</p>
<p>As implied by their name, controller actions are defined inside controllers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We’ll call our action <code>hello</code> and place it in the Application controller.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Indeed, at this point the Application controller is the only controller we have, which you can verify by running</p>

<p>Now that we have a working “hello, world” application, we’ll take a moment for a step that, while technically optional, would be viewed by experienced software developers as practically essential: placing our application source code under <em>version control</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Version control systems allow us to track changes to our project’s code, collaborate more easily, and roll back any inadvertent errors (such as accidentally deleting files).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Knowing how to use a version control system is a required skill for every professional-grade software developer.</p>
<p>There are many options for version control, but the Rails community has largely standardized on <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git</a>, a distributed version control system originally developed by Linus Torvalds to host the Linux kernel.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Git is a large subject, and we’ll only be scratching the surface in this book; for a more thorough introduction, see <a href="http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous</em></a>.<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-18" class="footnote"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-18">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Putting your source code under version control with Git is <em>strongly</em> recommended, not only because it’s nearly a universal practice in the Rails world, but also because it will allow you to back up and share your code more easily (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-bitbucket" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.4.3</span></a>) and deploy your application right here in the first chapter (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-deploying" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.5</span></a>).</p>
<div id="sec-git_setup" data-tralics-id="uid98" class="subsection" data-number="1.4.1"><h3><a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-git_setup" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">1.4.1 </span>Installation and setup</a></h3>
<p>The cloud IDE recommended in <a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-development_environment" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.2.1</span></a> includes Git by default, so no installation is necessary in this case.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Otherwise, <a href="http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous</em></a> includes <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial#sec-installation_and_setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instructions</a> for installing Git on your system.</p>
<div id="uid99" data-tralics-id="uid99" class="subsubsection" data-number="1.4.1.1"><h4><a href="#uid99" class="heading">First-time system setup</a></h4>
<p>Before using Git, you should perform a couple of one-time setup steps.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> These are <em>system</em> setups, meaning you only have to do them once per computer:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> git config --global user.name <span class="s2">"Your Name"</span>
<span class="gp">$</span> git config --global user.email your.email@example.com
</pre></div></div>
<p>Note that the name and email address you use in your Git configuration will be available in any repositories you make public.</p>
</div>
<div id="sec-first_time_setup" data-tralics-id="uid100" class="subsubsection" data-number="1.4.1.2"><h4><a href="#sec-first_time_setup" class="heading">First-time repository setup</a></h4>
<p>Now we come to some steps that are necessary each time you create a new <em>repository</em> (sometimes called a <em>repo</em> for short).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The first step is to navigate to the root directory of the first app and initialize a new repository:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> git init
<span class="go">Initialized empty Git repository in /home/ubuntu/workspace/hello_app/.git/</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>The next step is to add all the project files to the repository using <code>git add -A</code>:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> git add -A
</pre></div></div>
<p>This command adds all the files in the current directory apart from those that match the patterns in a special file called <code>.gitignore</code>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The <code>rails new</code> command automatically generates a <code>.gitignore</code> file appropriate to a Rails project, but you can add additional patterns as well.<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-19" class="footnote"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>The added files are initially placed in a <em>staging area</em>, which contains pending changes to our project.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We can see which files are in the staging area using the <code>status</code> command:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> git status
<span class="go">On branch master</span>

<span class="go">Initial commit</span>

<span class="go">Changes to be committed:</span>
<span class="go">  (use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)</span>

<span class="go">  new file:   .gitignore</span>
<span class="go">  new file:   Gemfile</span>
<span class="go">  new file:   Gemfile.lock</span>
<span class="go">  new file:   README.md</span>
<span class="go">  new file:   Rakefile</span>
<span class="go">  .</span>
<span class="go">  .</span>
<span class="go">  .</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>To tell Git we want to keep the changes, we use the <code>commit</code> command:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> git commit -m <span class="s2">"Initialize repository"</span>
<span class="go">[master (root-commit) df0a62f] Initialize repository</span>
<span class="go">.</span>
<span class="go">.</span>
<span class="go">.</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>The <code>-m</code> flag lets us add a message for the commit; if we omit <code>-m</code>, Git will open the system’s default editor and have us enter the message there.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> (All the examples in this book will use the <code>-m</code> flag.)</p>
<p>It is important to note that Git commits are <em>local</em>, recorded only on the machine on which the commits occur.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We’ll see how to push the changes up to a remote repository (using <code>git push</code>) in <a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-git_commands" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.4.4</span></a>.</p>
<p>By the way, we can see a list of the commit messages using the <code>log</code> command:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">commit af72946fbebc15903b2770f92fae9081243dd1a1</span>

<span class="go">Date:   Thu May 12 19:25:07 2016 +0000</span>

<span class="go">    Initialize repository</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>Depending on the length of the repository’s log history, you may have to type <code>q</code> to quit.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> (As explained in <a href="http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous</em></a>, <code>git log</code> uses the <code>less</code> interface <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial#sec-less_is_more" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> in <a href="http://learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous</em></a>.)</p>

<div id="sec-what_good_does_git_do_you" data-tralics-id="uid102" class="subsection" data-number="1.4.2"><h3><a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-what_good_does_git_do_you" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">1.4.2 </span>What good does Git do you?</a></h3>
<p>If you’ve never used version control before, it may not be entirely clear at this point what good it does you, so let me give just one example.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Suppose you’ve made some accidental changes, such as (D’oh!) deleting the critical <code>app/controllers/</code> directory.</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> ls app/controllers/
<span class="go">application_controller.rb  concerns/</span>
<span class="gp">$</span> rm -rf app/controllers/
<span class="gp">$</span> ls app/controllers/
<span class="go">ls: app/controllers/: No such file or directory</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>Here we’re using the Unix <code>ls</code> command to list the contents of the <code>app/controllers/</code> directory and the <code>rm</code> command to remove it (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#table-unix_commands" class="hyperref">Table <span class="ref">1.1</span></a>).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial#sec-removing_directories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> in <a href="http://learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous</em></a>, the <code>-rf</code> flag means “recursive force”, which recursively removes all files, directories, subdirectories, and so on, without asking for explicit confirmation of each deletion.</p>
<p>Let’s check the status to see what changed:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> git status
<span class="go">On branch master</span>
<span class="go">Changed but not updated:</span>
<span class="go">  (use "git add/rm &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)</span>
<span class="go">  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)</span>

<span class="go">      deleted:    app/controllers/application_controller.rb</span>

<span class="go">no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>We see here that a file has been deleted, but the changes are only on the “working tree”; they haven’t been committed yet.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This means we can still undo the changes using the <code>checkout</code> command with the <code>-f</code> flag to force overwriting the current changes:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> git checkout -f
<span class="gp">$</span> git status
<span class="gp">#</span> On branch master
<span class="go">nothing to commit (working directory clean)</span>
<span class="gp">$</span> ls app/controllers/
<span class="go">application_controller.rb  concerns/</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>The missing files and directories are back.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s a relief!</p>

<p>Now that we’ve put our project under version control with Git, it’s time to push our code up to <a href="http://www.bitbucket.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitbucket</a>, a site optimized for hosting and sharing Git repositories.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> (<a href="http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous</em></a> uses <a href="http://www.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, but see <a href="beginning_fragment.html#aside-github_bitbucket" class="hyperref">Box <span class="ref">1.4</span></a> to learn the reasons why this tutorial uses Bitbucket instead.)<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Putting a copy of your Git repository at Bitbucket serves two purposes: it’s a full backup of your code (including the full history of commits), and it makes any future collaboration much easier.</p>
<div class="aside" id="aside-github_bitbucket" data-tralics-id="uid104" data-number="1.4"><div class="heading"><span class="number">Box 1.4.</span> 

<span class="description">GitHub and Bitbucket</span></div>
<p>By far the two most popular sites for hosting Git repositories are GitHub and Bitbucket.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The two services share many similarities: both sites allow for Git repository hosting and collaboration, as well as offering convenient ways to browse and search repositories.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The important differences (from the perspective of this tutorial) are that GitHub offers unlimited free repositories (with collaboration) for open-source repositories while charging for private repos, whereas Bitbucket allows unlimited free private repos while charging for more than a certain number of collaborators.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Which service you use for a particular repo thus depends on your specific needs.</p>
<p><a href="http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous</em></a> (and some previous editions of this tutorial) use GitHub because of its emphasis on supporting open-source code, but growing concerns about security have led me to recommend that <em>all</em> web application repositories be private by default.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The issue is that such repositories might contain potentially sensitive information such as cryptographic keys or passwords, which could be used to compromise the security of a site running the code.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It is possible, of course, to arrange for this information to be handled securely (by having Git ignore it, for example), but this is error-prone and requires significant expertise.</p>
<p>As it happens, the sample application created in this tutorial is safe for exposure on the web, but it is dangerous to rely on this fact in general.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Thus, to be as secure as possible, we will err on the side of caution and use private repositories by default.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Since GitHub charges for private repositories while Bitbucket offers an unlimited number for free, for our present purposes Bitbucket is a better fit than GitHub.</p>
<p>(By the way, recently a third major Git hosting company has emerged, called <a href="http://gitlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitLab</a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Originally designed principally as an open-source Git tool you hosted yourself, GitLab now offers a hosted version as well, and in fact allows for unlimited public <em>and</em> private repositories.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This makes GitLab an excellent alternative to GitHub or Bitbucket for future projects.)</p>

</div><p>Getting started with Bitbucket is straightforward, though it may take a little technical sophistication (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#aside-technical_sophistication" class="hyperref">Box <span class="ref">1.1</span></a>) to get everything to work just right:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sign up for a Bitbucket account</a> if you don’t already have one.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>

<p>If you’ve followed the steps in <a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-bitbucket" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.4.3</span></a>, you might notice that Bitbucket automatically rendered the repository’s README file, as shown in <a href="beginning_fragment.html#fig-bitbucket_repository_page" class="hyperref">Figure <span class="ref">1.17</span></a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This file, called <code>README.md</code>, was generated automatically by the command in <a href="beginning_fragment.html#code-rails_command" class="hyperref">Listing <span class="ref">1.3</span></a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As indicated by the filename extension <code>.md</code>, it is written in <em>Markdown</em>,<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-21" class="footnote"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-21">21</a></sup> a human-readable markup language designed to be easy to convert to HTML—which is exactly what Bitbucket has done.</p>
<p>This automatic rendering of the README is convenient, but of course it would be better if we tailored the contents of the file to the project at hand.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In this section, we’ll customize the README by adding some Rails Tutorial–specific content.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In the process, we’ll see a first example of the branch, edit, commit, merge workflow that I recommend using with Git.<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-22" class="footnote"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-22">22</a></sup></p>

<div id="sec-git_branch" data-tralics-id="uid118" class="subsubsection" data-number="1.4.4.1"><h4><a href="#sec-git_branch" class="heading">Branch</a></h4>
<p>Git is incredibly good at making <em>branches</em>, which are effectively copies of a repository where we can make (possibly experimental) changes without modifying the parent files.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In most cases, the parent repository is the <em>master</em> branch, and we can create a new topic branch by using <code>checkout</code> with the <code>-b</code> flag:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="hll"><span class="gp">$</span> git checkout -b modify-README
</span><span class="go">Switched to a new branch 'modify-README'</span>
<span class="hll"><span class="gp">$</span> git branch
</span><span class="go">  master</span>
<span class="go">* modify-README</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>Here the second command, <code>git branch</code>, just lists all the local branches, and the asterisk <code>*</code> identifies which branch we’re currently on.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Note that <code>git checkout -b modify-README</code> both creates a new branch and switches to it, as indicated by the asterisk in front of the <code>modify-README</code> branch.</p>
<p>The full value of branching only becomes clear when working on a project with multiple developers,<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-23" class="footnote"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-23">23</a></sup> but branches are helpful even for a single-developer tutorial such as this one.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In particular, because the master branch is insulated from any changes we make to the topic branch, even if we <em>really</em> mess things up we can always abandon the changes by checking out the master branch and deleting the topic branch.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We’ll see how to do this at the end of the section.</p>
<p>By the way, for a change as small as this one I wouldn’t normally bother with a new branch (opting instead to work directly on the master branch), but in the present context it’s a prime opportunity to start practicing good habits.</p>

<p>With the changes made, we can take a look at the status of our branch:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="hll"><span class="gp">$</span> git status
</span><span class="go">On branch modify-README</span>
<span class="go">Changes not staged for commit:</span>
<span class="go">  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)</span>
<span class="go">  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)</span>

<span class="go">        modified:   README.md</span>

<span class="go">no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>At this point, we could use <code>git add -A</code> as in <a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-first_time_setup" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.4.1.2</span></a>, but <code>git commit</code> provides the <code>-a</code> flag as a shortcut for the (very common) case of committing all modifications to existing files:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="hll"><span class="gp">$</span> git commit -a -m <span class="s2">"Improve the README file"</span>
</span><span class="go">[modify-README 9dc4f64] Improve the README file</span>
<span class="go"> 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+), 22 deletions(-)</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>Be careful about using the <code>-a</code> flag improperly; if you have added any new files to the project since the last commit, you still have to tell Git about them using <code>git add -A</code> first.</p>
<p>Note that we write the commit message in the <em>present</em> tense (and, technically speaking, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imperative mood</a>).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Git models commits as a series of patches, and in this context it makes sense to describe what each commit <em>does</em>, rather than what it did.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Moreover, this usage matches up with the commit messages generated by Git commands themselves.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> See <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial#aside-commit_messages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Committing to Git</a> from <a href="http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous</em></a> for more information.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve finished making our changes, we’re ready to <em>merge</em> the results back into our master branch:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="hll"><span class="gp">$</span> git checkout master
</span><span class="go">Switched to branch 'master'</span>
<span class="hll"><span class="gp">$</span> git merge modify-README

<span class="go"> README.md | 27 +++++----------------------</span>
<span class="go"> 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+), 22 deletions(-)</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>Note that the Git output frequently includes things like <code>34f06b7</code>, which are related to Git’s internal representation of repositories.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Your exact results will differ in these details, but otherwise should essentially match the output shown above.</p>
<p>After you’ve merged in the changes, you can tidy up your branches by deleting the topic branch using <code>git branch -d</code> if you’re done with it:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="hll"><span class="gp">$</span> git branch -d modify-README
</span><span class="go">Deleted branch modify-README (was 9dc4f64).</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>This step is optional, and in fact it’s quite common to leave the topic branch intact.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This way you can switch back and forth between the topic and master branches, merging in changes every time you reach a natural stopping point.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, it’s also possible to abandon your topic branch changes, in this case with <code>git branch -D</code>:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># For illustration only; don't do this unless you mess up a branch</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>git checkout -b topic-branch

<span class="nv">$ </span>git commit -a -m <span class="s2">"Make major mistake"</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>git checkout master
<span class="nv">$ </span>git branch -D topic-branch
</pre></div></div>
<p>Unlike the <code>-d</code> flag, the <code>-D</code> flag will delete the branch even though we haven’t merged in the changes.</p>
</div>
<div id="sec-git_push" data-tralics-id="uid124" class="subsubsection" data-number="1.4.4.5"><h4><a href="#sec-git_push" class="heading">Push</a></h4>
<p>Now that we’ve updated the <code>README</code>, we can push the changes up to Bitbucket to see the result.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Since we have already done one push (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-bitbucket" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.4.3</span></a>), on most systems we can omit <code>origin master</code>, and simply run <code>git push</code>:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> git push

<p>Even though this is only the first chapter, we’re already going to deploy our (nearly empty) Rails application to production.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This step is optional, but deploying early and often allows us to catch any deployment problems early in our development cycle.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The alternative—deploying only after laborious effort sealed away in a development environment—often leads to terrible integration headaches when launch time comes.<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-24" class="footnote"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Deploying Rails applications used to be a pain, but the Rails deployment ecosystem has matured rapidly in the past few years, and now there are several great options.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> These include shared hosts or virtual private servers running <a href="http://www.modrails.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phusion Passenger</a> (a module for the Apache and Nginx<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-25" class="footnote"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-25">25</a></sup> webservers), full-service deployment companies such as <a href="http://engineyard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engine Yard</a> and <a href="http://railsmachine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rails Machine</a>, and cloud deployment services such as <a href="http://cloud.engineyard.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engine Yard Cloud</a> and <a href="http://heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroku</a>.</p>
<p>My favorite Rails deployment option is Heroku, which is a hosted platform built specifically for deploying Rails and other web applications.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Heroku makes deploying Rails applications ridiculously easy—as long as your source code is under version control with Git.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> (This is yet another reason to follow the Git setup steps in <a href="beginning_fragment.html#sec-version_control" class="hyperref">Section <span class="ref">1.4</span></a> if you haven’t already.)<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In addition, for many purposes, including for this tutorial, Heroku’s free tier is more than sufficient.</p>
<p>The rest of this section is dedicated to deploying our first application to Heroku.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Some of the ideas are fairly advanced, so don’t worry about understanding all the details; what’s important is that by the end of the process we’ll have deployed our application to the live web.</p>

</pre></div></div></div><p>To prepare the system for deployment to production, we run <code>bundle install</code> with a special flag to prevent the local installation of any production gems (which in this case consists of the <code class="tt">pg</code> gem):</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> bundle install --without production

<p>Because the only gem added in <a href="beginning_fragment.html#code-gemfile_pg_gem" class="hyperref">Listing <span class="ref">1.14</span></a> is restricted to a production environment, right now this command doesn’t actually install any additional local gems, but it’s needed to update <code>Gemfile.lock</code> with the <code class="tt">pg</code> gem.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We can commit the resulting change as follows:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> git commit -a -m <span class="s2">"Update Gemfile for Heroku"</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>Next we have to create and configure a new Heroku account.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The first step is to <a href="http://signup.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign up for Heroku</a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Then check to see if your system already has the Heroku command-line client installed:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> heroku version
</pre></div></div>
<p>Those using the cloud IDE should see the Heroku version number, indicating that the <code>heroku</code> CLI is available, but on other systems it may be necessary to install it using the <a href="https://toolbelt.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroku Toolbelt</a>.<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-27" class="footnote"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>Once you’ve verified that the Heroku command-line interface is installed, use the <code>heroku</code> command to log in and add your SSH key:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> heroku login
<span class="gp">$</span> heroku keys:add
</pre></div></div>
<p>Finally, use the <code>heroku create</code> command to create a place on the Heroku servers for the sample app to live (<a href="beginning_fragment.html#code-heroku_create" class="hyperref">Listing <span class="ref">1.15</span></a>).</p>

<p>There are many <a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/heroku-command" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroku commands</a>, and we’ll barely scratch the surface in this book.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Let’s take a minute to show just one of them by renaming the application as follows:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> heroku rename rails-tutorial-hello
</pre></div></div>
<p>Don’t use this name yourself; it’s already taken by me!<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In fact, you probably shouldn’t bother with this step right now; using the default address supplied by Heroku is fine.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But if you do want to rename your application, you can arrange for it to be reasonably secure by using a random or obscure subdomain, such as the following:</p>
<pre>hwpcbmze.herokuapp.com
seyjhflo.herokuapp.com
jhyicevg.herokuapp.com</pre>
<p>With a random subdomain like this, someone could visit your site only if you gave them the address.<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-28" class="footnote"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-28">28</a></sup><span class="intersentencespace"></span> (By the way, as a preview of Ruby’s compact awesomeness, here’s the code I used to generate the random subdomains:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'a'</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="s1">'z'</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shuffle</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="o">].</span><span class="n">join</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>Pretty sweet.)</p>
<p>In addition to supporting subdomains, Heroku also supports custom domains.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> (In fact, the <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby on Rails Tutorial site</a> lives at Heroku; if you’re reading this book online, you’re looking at a Heroku-hosted site right now!)<span class="intersentencespace"></span> See the <a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroku documentation</a> for more information about custom domains and other Heroku topics.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby on Rails is a web development framework written in the Ruby programming language.
</li>
<li>Installing Rails, generating an application, and editing the resulting files is easy using a pre-configured cloud environment.
</li>
<li>Rails comes with a command-line command called <code>rails</code> that can generate new applications (<code>rails new</code>) and run local servers (<code>rails server</code>).
</li>
<li>We added a controller action and modified the root route to create a “hello, world” application.
</li>
<li>We protected against data loss while enabling collaboration by placing our application source code under version control with Git and pushing the resulting code to a private repository at Bitbucket.
</li>
<li>We deployed our application to a production environment using Heroku.
